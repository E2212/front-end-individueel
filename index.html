        <h2>Introduction to Stamp Collecting</h2>

        <br>

        <p>What can you call a hobby which teaches so much—in addition to providing fun and pleasure?
            Stamp collecting helps instruct the collector in geography, biography, history, culture and art.
            Stamps are miniature gateways to the world.</p>

        <p>Stamp collecting has very few rules. You don't have to buy expensive sneakers or rackets to enjoy it.
            However, there are a few simple things to remember when collecting stamps.</p>

        <br>
        <br>

        <h2>Why Stamp Collecting?</h2>

        <br>

        <p>Stamps tell a story—of history, culture, and the passage of time.
            Each one is a tiny piece of art, a glimpse into a different place and era.</p>

        <p>From rare historical pieces to modern commemorative editions,
            this collection celebrates the beauty of stamps. Whether you are a
            seasoned philatelist or a curious beginner, there's something here for everyone.</p>

        <p>Browse through a carefully curated selection of postage treasures
            and discover stamps that hold historical significance, depict famous events,
            or showcase artistic craftsmanship.</p>

        <h2>Soaking Stamps</h2>
        <br>
        <p>You can always find stamps in your own mail box, or you can ask a local business to let you have stamps from
            their mail.
            But when you want to remove a stamp from an envelope, you will need to soak the stamp off.
            When you soak stamps off of the remnants of envelopes, all you really need is a container to hold the cool
            water while the stamps soak.</p>

        <figure>
            <img src="images/item-soaking.jpg" alt="Stamp soaking process" class="text-view-image">
            <figcaption>Stamps soaking in a bowl</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>It's best to let the stamps soak for perhaps 15 to 20 minutes, sometimes more depending on the quality of the
            paper and gum which is used.
            You can tell when the stamps are ready to be handled, they will float free from the envelopes.
            Not all stamps soak well.</p>

        <p>If you have stamps with purple ink or cancellations on them, you may want to soak them separately,
            because these colors may run, discoloring other items in the container.
            Others may require separate attention because of colors which may run from the envelopes on which the stamps
            were affixed.</p>

        <h2>Identifying Your Stamps</h2>
        <br>

        <h3>Finding the Category</h3>
        <p>Stamps come in all kinds of themes, and each one falls into a certain category.
            Here are some common ones:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Commemorative</b> – Special issues celebrating events, people, or anniversaries.</li>
            <li><b>Definitive</b> – Everyday stamps used for regular mailing.</li>
            <li><b>Seasonal</b> – Holiday-themed stamps, like Christmas or Lunar New Year designs.</li>
            <li><b>Sports</b> – Featuring sports events like the Olympics or World Cup.</li>
            <li><b>Nature</b> – Stamps showcasing wildlife, flowers, or scenic landscapes.</li>
            <li><b>Historical</b> – Stamps featuring famous figures, monuments, or past events.</li>
            <li><b>Transport</b> – Trains, ships, planes, or even space shuttles.</li>
            <li><b>Science</b> – Space exploration, scientific discoveries, or new technology.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Still not sure? Look at the design! If there's a rocket, it’s probably Science.
            A Christmas tree? That’s definitely Seasonal.</p>

        <br>

        <h3>Checking the Condition</h3>
        <p>Condition matters in stamp collecting. Here’s what collectors look for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Mint</b> – Perfect condition, never used, original gum intact.</li>
            <li><b>Excellent</b> – Almost flawless, minor imperfections.</li>
            <li><b>Good</b> – Some wear but still looks decent.</li>
            <li><b>Fair</b> – Visible damage, but still collectible.</li>
            <li><b>Used</b> – Has a postmark, but that adds to its story!</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To check a stamp’s condition, hold it under good lighting. Look for tears, creases,
            fading, or missing perforations (those tiny bumps along the edges). If it’s crisp and
            clean, it’s likely Mint!</p>

        <br>

        <h3>Figuring Out the Year</h3>
        <p>Finding the year is easy—most stamps have it printed somewhere on them. If you don’t
            see it, don’t worry! Google is your best friend. Just type in what the stamp looks like,
            and you’ll probably find the year in seconds.</p>
        <p>Another trick? If your stamp has a postmark (ink cancellation), that can give you an idea of
            when it was used. It might not be exact, but hey—it’s close enough!</p>
