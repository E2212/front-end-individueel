				<h2>Introduction to Stamp Collecting</h2>
				
				<br>
				
				<p>What can you call a hobby which teaches so much—in addition to providing fun and pleasure?
					Stamp collecting helps instruct the collector in geography, biography, history, culture and art.
				Stamps are miniature gateways to the world.</p>
				
				<p>Stamp collecting has very few rules. You don't have to buy expensive sneakers or rackets to enjoy it. 
				However, there are a few simple things to remember when collecting stamps.</p>

		<h2>Soaking Stamps</h2>
		<br>
		<p>You can always find stamps in your own mail box, or you can ask a local business to let you have stamps from their mail.
			But when you want to remove a stamp from an envelope, you will need to soak the stamp off.
		When you soak stamps off of the remnants of envelopes, all you really need is a container to hold the cool water while the stamps soak.</p>

		</figure>
		
		<p>It's best to let the stamps soak for perhaps 15 to 20 minutes, sometimes more depending on the quality of the paper and gum which is used.
			You can tell when the stamps are ready to be handled, they will float free from the envelopes.
		Not all stamps soak well.</p>
		
		<p>If you have stamps with purple ink or cancellations on them, you may want to soak them separately,
			because these colors may run, discoloring other items in the container.
		Others may require separate attention because of colors which may run from the envelopes on which the stamps were affixed.</p>
